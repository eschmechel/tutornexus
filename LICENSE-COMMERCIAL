# Commercial License for Tutor Nexus

This software is dual-licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
(AGPLv3) and a commercial license.

## Open Source License (AGPLv3)

The AGPLv3 license is suitable for open source projects and personal use.
See the `LICENSE` file for the full license text.

Key requirements of AGPLv3:
- You must make your complete source code available if you deploy this software
- Network use (SaaS) triggers the copyleft requirement
- Derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3

## Commercial License

A commercial license removes the copyleft requirements of the AGPLv3 and allows
you to:

- Deploy Tutor Nexus in proprietary/closed-source applications
- Offer Tutor Nexus as a SaaS without source disclosure
- Integrate with proprietary systems without license conflicts
- Receive priority support and custom feature development

### Pricing

Commercial licenses are available on a per-organization basis. Pricing is based
on usage tier and support requirements.
